* ### When you visit this site, it tells Facebook.

  The Facebook pixel is a snippet of code that sends data back to Facebook about people who visit this site and allows the site operator to later target them with ads on Facebook. A Facebook spokesperson told The Markup that the company set up this system so that a user doesn’t have to be “simultaneously logged into Facebook and viewing a third-party website for our business tools to function.” Common actions that can be tracked via pixel include viewing a page or specific content, adding payment information, or making a purchase. The Facebook pixel appeared in thirty percent of popular websites when we [scanned them](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector#survey) in September 2020.

* ### This site allows Google Analytics to follow you across the internet.

  This site uses Google Analytics and seems to use its ”remarketing audiences” feature that enables user tracking for targeted advertising across the internet. This feature allows a website to build custom audiences based on how a user interacts with this particular site and then follow those users across the internet and target them with advertising on other sites using Google Ads and Display & Video 360. A Google spokesperson told The Markup that site operators are [supposed to](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409?hl=en) inform visitors when data collected with this feature is used to connect this browsing data with someone’s real-world identity. You know when those shoes you were looking at follow you around the internet? This is one of the trackers leading to that. This feature appeared in fifty percent of popular websites when we [scanned them](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector#survey) in September 2020.
