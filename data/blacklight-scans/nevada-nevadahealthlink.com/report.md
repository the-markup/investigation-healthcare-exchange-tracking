* ### When you visit this site, it tells Facebook.

  The Facebook pixel is a snippet of code that sends data back to Facebook about people who visit this site and allows the site operator to later target them with ads on Facebook. A Facebook spokesperson told The Markup that the company set up this system so that a user doesn’t have to be “simultaneously logged into Facebook and viewing a third-party website for our business tools to function.” Common actions that can be tracked via pixel include viewing a page or specific content, adding payment information, or making a purchase. The Facebook pixel appeared in thirty percent of popular websites when we [scanned them](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector#survey) in September 2020.

* ### This website could be monitoring your keystrokes and mouse clicks.

  Blacklight detected the use of a session recorder, which tracks user mouse movement, clicks, taps, scrolls, or even network activity. This data is compiled into videos and heat maps that website owners can watch to see how users interact with the site. Research has shown these practices can be insecure and make sensitive user data such as passwords and credit card information more vulnerable to leaks. This technique was used by fifteen percent of popular websites when we [scanned them](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector#survey) in September 2020.

  Blacklight detected a script belonging to the company Hotjar Ltd doing this on this site.

  However... While Blacklight can detect whether a session recorder was loaded, it cannot determine exactly how the collected data is being used.
