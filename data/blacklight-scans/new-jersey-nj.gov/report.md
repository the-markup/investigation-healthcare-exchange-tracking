* ### When you visit this site, it tells Facebook.

  The Facebook pixel is a snippet of code that sends data back to Facebook about people who visit this site and allows the site operator to later target them with ads on Facebook. A Facebook spokesperson told The Markup that the company set up this system so that a user doesn’t have to be “simultaneously logged into Facebook and viewing a third-party website for our business tools to function.” Common actions that can be tracked via pixel include viewing a page or specific content, adding payment information, or making a purchase. The Facebook pixel appeared in thirty percent of popular websites when we [scanned them](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector#survey) in September 2020.
