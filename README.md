# How we found states sharing personal health data with LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Google

This repo contains data for our story ["We caught 4 more states sharing personal health data with Big Tech"](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2025/06/17/we-caught-4-more-states-sharing-personal-health-data-with-big-tech).

## Methodology

The Markup and CalMatters used The Markup's [Blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight) tool to scan the healthcare exchange websites of 19 states and the District of Columbia. We were looking for sites that shared personally identifying information through ad trackers and third-party cookies. Prioritizing the exchanges that had a greater than average number of trackers and cookies, we navigated each site as we watched activity in [the browser's network panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network). As we filled forms on the sites, we watched for communication with the platforms that our scans had identified as ad tracker providers. Through this process, we found that the exchange sites of the five states below were sending personal health data to advertising and analytics services.

For each state, we're providing a copy of our initial Blacklight scan, screenshots of the relevant network activity in the browser's network panel, and [a HAR file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)), which documents network activity. HAR files can be read [in many modern browsers](https://help.tanium.com/bundle/HARfile-Create-Read/page/KA/HARfile-Create-Read/HARfile-Create-Read.htm) and with the [HAR Analyzer tool](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/).

The network traffic captured in these HAR files was generated as a Markup reporter investigated the site, entering made-up data about people that don't exist. Personally identifying information has been redacted from the HAR files. Any unredacted information that appears to be personally identifying (e.g. names, birth dates, marital status, ethnicity, race, gender) is not real.

All [the initial Blacklight scans can be found here](data/blacklight-scans/), including those for states that we didn't find sharing personal health data.
